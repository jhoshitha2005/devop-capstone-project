**As a** registered user  
**I need** the ability to register for upcoming events  
**So that** I can participate in events of my interest and receive updates  

### Details and Assumptions
* Users must be logged in to register for any event  
* Event data (title, date, time, location, capacity, organizer info) is already available in the database  
* Users should not be able to register once an event is full  
* A confirmation email will be sent to the user upon successful registration  
* Duplicate registrations should be prevented  
* An event registration timestamp must be recorded in the backend  
* The UI must reflect the current registration status dynamically (e.g., buttons, alerts)  
* Canceling a registration should free up a spot  
* The system should handle at least 1000 concurrent registration requests  
* Registration activity should be logged for analytics/reporting  

###  Acceptance Criteria     
```gherkin
Given I am a logged-in user  
When I click the "Register" button on a specific event page  
Then I should be registered for the event and redirected to a confirmation page  

Given I have already registered for the event  
When I visit the event page again  
Then I should see a "You are already registered" message instead of the registration button  

Given the event has reached its maximum capacity  
When another user tries to register  
Then they should see a message saying "This event is full"  

Given a registered user cancels their registration  
When another user tries to register afterward  
Then the system should allow the new registration  

Given I register for an event  
When registration is successful  
Then I should receive a confirmation email with event details within 5 minutes  

Given I am on the dashboard  
When I click on "My Registered Events"  
Then I should see a list of all events Iâ€™ve registered for, sorted by date  

Given an unexpected server error occurs during registration  
When the user submits the form  
Then they should see an error message and the system should not create a partial record
